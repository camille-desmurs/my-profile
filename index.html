               Hello everyone, welcome to my profile page. My name is Camille and I am currently a first year BBA student at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/fr/" rel="ESSEC" target="_blank"> ESSEC</a>. <br/>I am fascinated by sport and the world around sport but also by music, series and books. I used <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/fr" rel="Le Wagon" target="_blank"> Le Wagon</a> thanks to my school to learn how to code because I think it is an important thing to know for the future. At the beginning I was pretty anxious about coding but now I love it!

            <p>
               I am a hudge fan of <strong>sports</strong>, I have been playing tennis for <strong>15 years</strong> at <a href="http://puc.paris/" rel="Paris University Club (PUC)" target="_blank"> <strong>PUC</strong></a> <br>
               Sport plays an important role in student's life. As it develops our physical and mental health. For me, adults should include it in their daily life. Sports are not only used for physical and mental health but also to create a high discipline and rigor in a person. When I was a child, I was playing tennis to make my career in it.

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p> I love listening to music. Music is one of the most important thing in my life. It is personal but, without music, my life would be absolutely empty.But that is not all, I have played piano since I was 10. Listening to and playing different types of music helps me to relax and it can also motivate me sometimes.I don't have a particular style of music, I listen to all types of music. I love listening to music on my way to school. I believe music has the ability to convey all sorts of emotion. Whether the emotion is joy and happiness or sadness, music shows it. For me, what music is able to create is amazing.  <br>

I have seen a real improvements in my communication skills. <br>
